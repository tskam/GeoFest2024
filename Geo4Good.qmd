## Demystifying Geospatial Analytics

-   A **Geographical Information System (GIS)** is a toolkit for creating, managing, analysing, visualising, and sharing data of any kind according to where it's located.

## Motivation of Geospatial Analytics

-   About 80% of all data maintained by organisations around the world has a location component.
